# epub_wordcount

Given the path to an epub file, do our best to count the number of words in it.

## Limitations

There's no programmatic representation for the table of contents in epub, it's hard to skip over the reviews, copyright, etc. We do our best, but if the chapters aren't labeled, then you just have to settle for a few hundred words more than you expect.

Pull requests welcome.
